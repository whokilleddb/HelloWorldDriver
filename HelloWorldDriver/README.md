# HelloWorldDriver

This repository details how to start writing your first ever Windows Driver. The main motivation for this has been to overcome the dread of venturing into the Kernel space and gradually learn Windows Kernel Exploitation techniques. 

## Prerequisite

For building and testing the Driver we need to have a couple of things:

-  Two windows Machines: One to develop the driver on, and another to test it on (this better be a Virtual Machine)
- On the Development machine - follow the steps listed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) to have the right SDK and WDK.
